(4) TROUBLESHOOTING    
-------------------    
The following are some of the more common problems you might have, and
recommended solutions:

A) There is no game sound.

   First, check all your connections between your speakers and your 
   computer.  Make sure your speakers are turned on and receiving power.  
   Make sure the volume is not turned down all the way.  You can change
   sound and music volume in the 'Options' window.
   If none of the above suggestions works, try producing sound in another 
   program.  If that does not work, make sure you have the sound driver
   enabled in your kernel.  Finally, go to http://www.opensound.com/
   to see whether a commercial driver is available for your sound card.

B) The game runs VERY slowly.

   You are probably running the game using software rendering.  You must
   have your 3D card configured for hardware accelerated rendering.
